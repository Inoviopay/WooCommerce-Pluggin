## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Error: "Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error"**

*Solution:*
```bash
# Check PHP error log
tail -f /var/log/php-error.log

# Common causes:
# - PHP version too old (need 5.2.4+)
# - Missing cURL extension
# - File permission issues

# Fix permissions
chmod -R 755 wp-content/plugins/inovio-payment-gateway
```

**Error: "The plugin does not have a valid header"**

*Solution:*
- Ensure `woocommerce-inovio-gateway.php` is in the root of plugin folder
- Correct structure: `plugins/inovio-payment-gateway/woocommerce-inovio-gateway.php`

### Database Issues

**Tables not created on activation**

*Solution:*
```bash
# Manually create tables via MySQL
mysql -u username -p database_name

# Paste SQL from includes/installer/inovio-plugin-database-table.php
```

Or deactivate and reactivate with debug:
```php
// Add to wp-config.php temporarily
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

### Payment Processing Issues

**Error: "Invalid API endpoint URL"**

*Solution:*
- Verify URL is exactly: `https://api.inoviopay.com/payment/pmt_service.cfm`
- No trailing spaces or slashes
- Must start with `https://`

**Error: "Please contact to service provider"**

*Solution:*
- API credentials are incorrect
- Double-check Site ID, Username, Password
- Contact Inovio support to verify account status

**SSL Certificate Errors**

*Solution:*
```bash
# Update CA certificates on server
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates

# Or for CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum update ca-certificates
```

### WooCommerce Subscriptions Issues

**Renewals not processing automatically**

*Solution:*
1. Check WooCommerce > Status > Scheduled Actions
2. Look for failed actions related to subscriptions
3. Verify initial payment stored token correctly:
   ```sql
   SELECT meta_value FROM wp_postmeta
   WHERE meta_key = '_inovio_gateway_scheduled_first_response'
   AND post_id = [order_id];
   ```
4. Check if `SSPI_DONE` constant is preventing duplicate runs
